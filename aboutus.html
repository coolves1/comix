    <h2>Here's my story</h2>
    <p>
      I have grown up reading comic books and collecting trading cards. Which can be said for a lot of people arond the world.
      What this site does is, it makes it accesible to people all over the world. This site is a safe heaven for people who
      just want a cool nice community to go to where they can nerd out about comics. I know how hard it can be to connect with
      people through comics. This site makes it a lot easier to find people to nerd out with on something you truly love.
